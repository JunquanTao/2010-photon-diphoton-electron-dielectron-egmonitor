# CMS OpenData Analysis with electron(s) in the final status

A brief introduction for this repo which contains two simple examples for:

a) the single electron analysis with the producer "SingleElectronAnalyzer"

b) the double electron analysis with the producer "TwoElectronAnalyzer"

Both examples exercises running locally on Run2010B electron data in the AOD format, http://opendata.cern.ch/record/4.

The codes were used for quick check on the plots of electron/dielectron objects. The usage is similar to teh package DecaysToPhotons/.
